Dr Egg Adventures

Our team is building a web portal for Dr Egg Adventures, where specific requirements will be met. 

npm start - will open the react app
npm run server - will make a connection to the json-server and view data on the web portal (as of the moment a dummy server with limited data is avaliable but will be chnaged by the backend developers)
